# EcommerceApplication_FreelanceProject

I developed an e-commerce application for a client, allowing them to showcase their products and provide customers with an easy-to-use platform. The website includes an admin module that enables the client to add products with multiple images, colors, and sizes, as well as manage orders. Customers can view and filter products, add them to their cart, submit orders, login, and sign up. The application was built using ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, Identity Framework, SQL Server database, and front-end web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. I deployed the application on GoDaddy and ensured that it was fully functional, user-friendly, and met the client's requirements.

Unfortunately, I am unable to share the code for this project as it is private and belongs to the client. However, I can provide you with a demo that showcases the result of the project.
